# ✈️ Airways Reservation System (Core Java + GUI)

A simple yet functional Airways Reservation System developed using only **Core Java** and **GUI components** (like Swing or AWT). This project simulates a basic flight reservation system where users can search flights, book tickets, and manage their bookings — all within a standalone desktop application.
